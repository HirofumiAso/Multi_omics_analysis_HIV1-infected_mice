# Descriptions

Digital RNA-sequencing (dRNA-Seq) ([Shiroguchi et al, PNAS, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1118018109)) can accurately measure the absolute number of RNA molecules genome wide even from a small number of cells due to low noise and bias during the amplification and sequencing processes.

Raw data are depositted in GEO (GSE137644).

Program details will be published shortly in another study.

## Expression Matrix
The method to acquire the expression matrix of dRNA-Seq data is described in manuscripts [Aso, Nagaoka, and Kawakami et al., Cell Reports, 2020].

Please see also a paper ([Tenno et al., J Exp Med., 2017] (https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20170729)).

## Transcription factor target enrichment analysis
Transcription factor target enrichment analysis was performed by weighted parametric gene set analysis (wPGSA) [Kawakami et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 2016].
