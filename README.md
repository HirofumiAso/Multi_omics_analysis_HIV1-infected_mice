For eradication of HIV-1 infection, it is important to elucidate the detailed features and heterogeneity of HIV-1-infected cells in vivo. To reveal multiple characteristics of HIV-1-producing cells in vivo, we used a hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model infected with a GFP-encoding replication-competent HIV-1. To identify the features of HIV-1-infected cells, we performed multi-omics experiments using recently developed technology.
