# Descriptions

Linker-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) is a PCR- and NGS-based method to detect the integration sites (ISs) of HIV-1 systematically.
The details of LM-PCR are described elsewhere ([Satou et al, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07307-4)).


This directory contains two sub directories:
1. **detect\_IS**: an analytical pipeline to detect HIV-1 ISs from raw fastq files generated by LM-PCR
2. **enrichment\_analysis**: program to calculate the fold enrichment of overlaps between HIV-1 ISs and specific histone marks
